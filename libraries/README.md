# Intro to robotics libraries

## Description
This folder contains C++ classes which are used in several examples and external Arduino libraries. 

The classes I put here **do not pretend to be production quality libraries** (and .zip files don't contain 
all the necessary information - only code). They were puth here just to avoid copying files from one example 
to another.
