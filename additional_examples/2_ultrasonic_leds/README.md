# 2. Ultrasonic with six LEDs

## Description
Six LEDs show the distance measured by an ultrasonic sensor. The smaller distance the more LEDs are on.

## Hardware used
* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard
* 6 * 1 KOhm resistor
* 6 * LED
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

## New hardware knowledge

## New C++ knowledge

## Requirements
* LedLine and Ultrasonic libraries must be imported to Arduino IDE. See libraries/README.md, libraries/LedLine and 
libraries/Ultrasonic
