# 8. Ultrasonic with six LEDs

## Description
Six LEDs show the distance measured by an ultrasonic sensor. The smaller distance the more LEDs are on.

## Hardware used
* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard
* 6 * 1 KOhm resistor
* 6 * LED
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

## New hardware knowledge

## New C++ knowledge
* Re-use of classes (LedLine, Ultrasonic)

## Notes
* files of LedLine and Ultrasonic classes can be zipped and added to Arduino IDE as a library as soon as we used it already in 2 
examples
* in next example external libraries usage will be shown (e.g. in remote-controlled wheel platform)
